The main objective of this project is to study and implement well-known ciphers.

While most implementations are straightforward and not highly optimized (as specific cryptographic libraries exist for that purpose), they are sufficient for me to achieve a solid understanding of each cipher."

Current ciphers coded:

-Caesar cipher \
-Vigenere cipher \
-Affine cipher \
-Hill cipher \
-Railfence cipher (not decryption code yet) \
-Columnar transposition cipher \
-One time pad cipher \
-AES cipher \
-DES cipher \
-3DES cipher \
-RC4 cipher \
